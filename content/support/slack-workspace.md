For informal communication with LAMMPS developers you may ask to join the
LAMMPS developers on Slack at https://lammps.slack.com.

This Slack work space is by invitation only for developers only. Thus for
access, please send an e-mail to "slack at lammps.org", and explain what
part of LAMMPS you are working on.

Also note that the slack channel is only for discussions related to LAMMPS
development and *not* for people looking for help with compiling, installing,
or using LAMMPS. For those purposes, please post a message to the LAMMPS
MatSci forum or the lammps-users mailing list.
