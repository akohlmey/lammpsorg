**LAMMPS** stands for
**L**arge-scale **A**tomic/**M**olecular **M**assively **P**arallel **S**imulator.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code with a focus on
materials modeling.  It was designed to run efficiently on parallel
computers and to be easily expanded and modified.  It was developed
originally at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy
facility and is not jointly maintained by researchers at Sandia and at
Temple University.  It includes contributions from many researchers from
all around the globe.  The majority of funding for developing and
maintaining the LAMMPS code has come from the US Department of Energy
(DOE).  LAMMPS is open-source software, distributed freely under the
