This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for the
LAMMPS molecular dynamics package. It also lists periodic "stable"
versions which have undergone more testing and will receive occasional
bugfix patches.

In some cases, new features change the syntax or operation of an
existing input script command, which can cause LAMMPS output to change,
or even "break" an earlier working script. These cases are highlighted
below with a "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY" note.
